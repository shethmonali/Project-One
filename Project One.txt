Main Question:  How does median household income per capita affect the count of Yelp reviews and the subsequent ratings
                Do resturants in zip codes where the per capita income is higher have higher rankings as well?
                How do population dempgraphics affect Yelp review count and ratings?
                Is there a differnce in review patterns by race? By age?
